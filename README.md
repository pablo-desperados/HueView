# HueView - Color Match Search
Project for CSC-575 Intelligent Information Retreival at DePaul University.
A work-in-progress color matching search engine project for artists powered by WikiMedia by Pablo Mujica and Tessa Hall in Python.

## Details
- Color-driven image retrieval and browsing system focused on color-based search.
- Images from WikiMedia are not stored directly, to save storage space.
- Results with a primary (predominant) image color within a threshold of the query color will be returned, weighted and ranked by the prevalence of the relevant color in the image.

## Developing
- [Project Roadmap](ROADMAP.md)
- [Build Notes](BUILDING.md)
